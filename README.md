# ðŸ‘‹ Hey!

My name is Rodrigo and I spill Javascript everywhere.

<img style="width: 48%;" align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piducancore/piducancore/main/wolf-of-javascript.png">

I started my coding journey with [freeCodeCamp(ðŸ”¥)](https://www.freecodecamp.org), where I got the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/piducancore/responsive-web-design) and [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/piducancore/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) certifications.

Soon after, I got on tech Twitter (I'm [@piducancore](https://twitter.com/piducancore) over there) and discovered I had to learn React, which I did. It was 2019. Gatsby was still great. They even gave me a t-shirt for [contributing a starter project](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/16117) based on [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/): [`gatsby-starter-apollo-netlify`](https://github.com/piducancore/gatsby-starter-apollo-netlify), still my most starred repository on GitHub.

I wanted to [make]() [everything]() [GraphQL]() back then.

## How is it going

Many projects after, in 2022, I know not everything has to have GraphQL, and I've built an interesting variety of projects using JAMstack technologies, both personal art projects and commission work as an independent consultant.

Below I show you the most recent and the ones that I'm most proud of.
