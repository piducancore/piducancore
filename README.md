# 👋 Hey!
<!--
My name is **Rodrigo** and I spill Javascript everywhere.

<img style="width: 48%;" align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piducancore/piducancore/main/wolf-of-javascript.png">

I started my coding journey with [freeCodeCamp(🔥)](https://www.freecodecamp.org), where I got the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/piducancore/responsive-web-design) and [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/piducancore/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) certifications.

Soon after, I got on tech Twitter (I'm [@piducancore](https://twitter.com/piducancore) over there) and discovered I had to learn React, which I did. It was 2019. Gatsby was still great. They even gave me a t-shirt for [contributing a starter project](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/16117) based on [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/): [`gatsby-starter-apollo-netlify`](https://github.com/piducancore/gatsby-starter-apollo-netlify), still my most starred repository on GitHub.

I wanted to [make]() [everything](https://github.com/piducancore/datasets-graphql) [GraphQL](https://github.com/piducancore/sheetpoetry.xyz) back then.

Many projects after, in 2022, I know not everything has to have GraphQL, and I've built a small variety of projects using JAMstack technologies, both personal art projects and commission work as an independent consultant.

# Work

Below I show you the most recent and the ones I am most proud of.

## sheetforms.co ([see working demo](https://sheetforms.co))

An open API to save any form's data to a Google Spreadsheet.

Use this when you need to collect data using your own custom forms, but you don't feel like building a whole backend to do it.

Repository: [piducancore/sheetforms.co](https://github.com/piducancore/sheetforms.co)

In addition to the above, I've also built some cool stuff with **serverless functions**, thanks to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) free plans ❤️

- [**`serverless-puppeteer-screenshots`**](https://github.com/piducancore/serverless-puppeteer-screenshots)

  This public API can take a screenshot from any URL you pass to it, using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev).

- [**`serverless-tts-api`**](https://github.com/piducancore/serverless-tts-api)

  This is a minimal example of a _serverless_ Text to Speech API using [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-text-to-speech).

- [**`anda-al-gimnasio`**](https://github.com/piducancore/anda-al-gimnasio)

  This scheduled function runs everyday and reserves my gym hours, then notifies me via [Telegram](https://www.telegram.org).
